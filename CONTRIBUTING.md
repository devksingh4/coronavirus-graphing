# Contributing Guidelines

This project accept contributions via GitHub pull requests.
This document outlines some of the
conventions on development workflow, commit message formatting, contact points,
and other resources to make it easier to get your contribution accepted.

## Certificate of Origin

By contributing to this project, you agree to the [Developer Certificate of
Origin (DCO)](https://developercertificate.org/). This document was created by the Linux Kernel community and is a
simple statement that you, as a contributor, have the legal right to make the
contribution.

In order to show your agreement with the DCO you should include at the end of the commit message,
the following line: `Signed-off-by: John Doe <john.doe@example.com>`, using your real name.

This can be done easily using the [`-s`](https://github.com/git/git/blob/b2c150d3aa82f6583b9aadfecc5f8fa1c74aca09/Documentation/git-commit.txt#L154-L161) flag on the `git commit`.

Visual Studio code also has a flag to enable signoff on commits 

If you find yourself pushed a few commits without `Signed-off-by`, you can still add it afterwards. Read this for help: [fix-DCO.md](https://github.com/src-d/guide/blob/master/developer-community/fix-DCO.md).
